<div id='1'/> 

#### Question no.1

<i>e → a (You can edit only if you are an administrator.)</i>


<div id='2'/> 

#### Question no.2

<i>m → (e ∨ p) (You can see the movie only if you are over 18 or have parental permission.)</i>


<div id="3"></div>

#### Question no.3 

<i>g → (r ∧ ¬m ∧ ¬b) (You can graduate only if you completed major requirements, owe no money, and have no overdue book.)</i>


<div id="4"></div>

#### Question no.4

<i>w → (s ∨ d) (You can use the wireless network only if you are a subscriber or pay the daily fee.)</i>


<div id="5">

#### Question no.5

<i>e → [a ∧ (b ∨ p) ∧ r] (You are eligible only if: at least 35, (born in USA or parents citizens), and lived at least 14 years in USA.)</i>


<div id="6">

#### Question no.6

<i>u → [(b32 ∧ g1 ∧ r1 ∧ h16) ∨ (b64 ∧ g2 ∧ r2 ∧ h32)] (You can upgrade only if you meet hardware requirements for either 32-bit or 64-bit configurations.)</i>


<div id='7'>

#### Question no.7  

<b>a</b> . <i>q → p</i>

<b>b</b> . <i>q ∧ ¬p</i>

<b>c</b> . <i>q → p</i>

<b>d</b> . <i>¬q → ¬p</i>


<div id="8">

#### Question no.8

<b>a</b> . <i>r ∧ ¬p</i>

<b>b</b> . <i>(r ∧ p) → q</i>

<b>c</b> . <i>¬r → ¬q</i>

<b>d</b> . <i>(¬p ∧ r) → q</i>


<div id="9">

#### Question no.9

<i>No — inconsistent. One can show that the statements lead to a contradiction (specifically, the last statement “The system is not in interrupt mode” combined with earlier statements forces the system to be in interrupt mode).</i>



<div id="10">

#### Question no.10

<i>Yes — consistent. All statements can be true simultaneously (possible scenario: system software is being upgraded → users cannot access file system → cannot save new files).</i>


<div id="11">

#### Question no.11

<i>Yes — consistent. Possible assignment: router does not support new address space, latest software not installed, router cannot send packets to edge system.</i>


<div id="12">

#### Question no.12

<i>No — inconsistent. From “New messages will not be sent to the message buffer” and earlier condition, we derive that new messages will be sent to the buffer → contradiction.</i>


<div id="13">

#### Question no.13

<b>New Jersey beaches</b> . <i>"beaches" AND "New Jersey"</i>

<b>Isle of Jersey beaches</b> . <i>("Jersey" AND beaches) NOT "New Jersey" OR ("Jersey" AND "Channel Islands")</i>


<div id="14">

#### Question no.14

<b>West Virginia hiking</b> . <i>hiking AND "West Virginia"</i>

<b>Virginia but not West Virginia</b> . <i>hiking AND Virginia NOT "West Virginia"</i>


<div id="15">


#### Question no.15

<i>Ethiopian restaurants AND ("New York" OR "New Jersey")</i>


<div id="16">

#### Question no.16

<i>(men’s shoes OR men’s boots) NOT work</i>


<div id="17">

#### Question no.17

<b>a</b> . <i>No — contradiction (Queen cannot say all inscriptions are false).</i>

<b>b</b> . <i>Yes — treasure in Trunk 1.</i>

<b>c</b> . <i>No — contradiction (cannot satisfy exactly two true).</i>

<b>d</b> . <i>No — contradiction (all three cannot be true).</i>


<div id="18">

#### Question no.18

<b>a</b> . <i>No — contradiction (all false impossible with 2 treasures).</i>

<b>b</b> . <i>Yes — treasures in Trunks 2 and 3.</i>

<b>c</b> . <i>Yes — treasures in Trunks 1 and 3.</i>

<b>d</b> . <i>No — contradiction (all three cannot be true).</i>


<div id="19">

#### Question no.19

<i>Ask: “If I asked you whether the left branch leads to the ruins, would you say ‘Yes’?” If they say Yes, take left; if No, take right.</i>


<div id="20">

#### Question no.20

<b>a</b> . <i>Both truth-teller and liar would answer “No” to “Are you a liar?” (truth-teller: no; liar: lying about being liar → also says no). So it doesn’t distinguish them.</i>

<b>b</b> . <i>Ask: “If I asked you whether you always tell the truth, would you say ‘Yes’?” Truth-teller → Yes; liar → No.</i>


<div id="21">

#### Question no.21

<i>The first professor didn’t know → they want coffee (if they didn’t want coffee, they’d know not everyone wants). The second professor didn’t know → they want coffee (and they knew first wants coffee). The third professor said “No, not everyone” → they don’t want coffee. So first and second want coffee, third does not.</i>


<div id="22">

#### Question no.22

<i>Let J = Jasmine attends, S = Samir attends, K = Kanti attends.

Conditions: (J → ¬S) or (J → S unhappy? Usually means if J attends and S attends → unhappy, so J → ¬S), (S → K), (K → J).

From K → J and S → K, we get S → J. Also J → ¬S. Combining S → J and J → ¬S implies S → ¬S → S false. So S cannot attend. If S not attend, K can be false without violating K → J? Wait, K → J means if K attends then J attends, but K not attend is fine.

Also J can attend if S not attend. K can attend only if J attends, but then S would have to attend for S → K (not required, S false). Let’s check cases:

Possible: J alone; J and K together; none; K alone? No (K → J). So invite: {J} or {J, K} or {}.</i>


<div id="23">

#### Question no.23

<i>If A were a knight, statement “At least one of us is a knave” would be true → B must be knave (since A is knight). That is consistent.
If A were a knave, statement would be false → both must be knights, contradiction (A can’t be knave and knight).
Thus A is knight, B is knave.</i>


<div id="24">

#### Question no.24

<i>A says “Both knights.” If A knight → both knights → B knight. But B says “A is knave” would then be false → B knave → contradiction.
If A knave → statement false → at least one is knave. B says “A is knave” which is true. But B could be knight or spy? Only knights/knaves here. If B knight → tells truth → A knave, consistent. If B knave → lies → “A is knave” false → A knight, contradiction.
So A knave, B knight.</i>


<div id="25">

#### Question no.25

<i>A: “I am knave or B is knight.” If A knight → statement true → (A knave or B knight) true; A knave false, so B knight must be true → B knight, consistent.
If A knave → statement false → (A knave or B knight) false → A not knave and B not knight → A not knave contradicts A knave.
So A knight, B knight.</i>


<div id="26">

#### Question no.26

<i>Both say “I am a knight.”
If A knight → truth → ok. If A knave → lie → “I am knight” false → A knave, ok. So both could be knights, both knaves, or one each. Cannot determine from just that.</i>


<div id="27">

#### Question no.27

<i>A says “We are both knaves.” If A knight → both knaves → A knave contradiction.
So A knave → statement false → not both knaves → B must be knight.
Thus A knave, B knight.</i>


<div id="28">

#### Question no.28

<i>A: C is knave. B: A is knight. C: I am spy.
Try A knight → C knave (true), B’s statement “A knight” true → B knight or spy (but knight already A) → B spy. C knave → C’s statement false (“I am spy”) → consistent.
Other cases fail. Unique: A knight, B spy, C knave.</i>


<div id="29">

#### Question no.29

<i>A: I am knight. B: I am knave. C: B is knight.
B says “I am knave” → if B knave → true → knave can’t tell truth → contradiction. So B not knave.
If B knight → “I am knave” false → knight can’t lie → contradiction. So B not knight → B spy.
Then A and C are knight & knave. If A knight → A’s statement true, C knave → C’s statement “B is knight” false (B spy) → knave lying ok. Works.
If A knave → C knight → C says “B knight” false (B spy) → knight lying contradiction.
So unique: A knight, B spy, C knave.</i>


<div id="30">

#### Question no.30

<i>All say “I am knave.” Knave can’t say “I am knave” truthfully. So none can be knave? But need one knave. Contradiction → no solution.</i>


<div id="31">

#### Question no.31

<i>A: I am knight. B: A telling truth. C: I am spy.
If A knight → B’s statement true → B knight or spy → but knight taken → B spy. Then C knave → C’s statement false (C knave) → ok. Works.
If B knight → B’s statement “A telling truth” true → A knight → two knights impossible.
If C knight → C’s statement false → impossible.
Unique: A knight, B spy, C knave.</i>


<div id="32">

#### Question no.32

<i>A: I am knight. B: A not knave. C: B not knave.
Try A knight → B’s statement true → B spy or knight (knight taken) → B spy. Then C knave → C’s statement “B not knave” true (B spy) → knave telling truth impossible. So A not knight.
If A knave → A’s statement false. B’s statement “A not knave” false → B lying → B knave or spy. But if B knave → two knaves impossible. So B spy. Then C knight → C’s statement “B not knave” true (B spy) → ok.
Check: A knave, B spy, C knight. Works.
Unique: A knave, B spy, C knight.</i>


<div id="33">

#### Question no.33

<i>All say “I am knight.” Each can be knight (truth) or knave/spy (lie). Need one knight, one knave, one spy. If only one knight, others lying → possible. If only one knave, others truth-telling? Spy can lie or tell truth. Multiple permutations possible: 6 total assignments possible.</i>


<div id="34">

#### Question no.34

<i>A: not spy. B: not spy. C: A is spy.
Try A spy → A’s statement false → spy lying ok. B’s statement “not spy” true → B knight or knave. C’s statement “A spy” true → C knight or spy. But spy taken (A) → C knight. Then B knave → B’s statement false (“not spy” when B knave) → knave lying ok. Works: A spy, B knave, C knight.
Check other cases: If C spy → different assignments fail. Unique: A spy, B knave, C knight.</i>


<div id="35">

#### Question no.35

<i>All say “I am not spy.”
Spy could lie (“I am not spy” false) or tell truth? Actually spy saying “I am not spy” is false if spy, so spy would lie.
Knight says truth “not spy” → ok. Knave says “not spy” but is knave → truth? Knave must lie, so knave can’t say “I am not spy” truthfully. So knave must be spy? But only one spy. Contradiction → no solution.</i>
